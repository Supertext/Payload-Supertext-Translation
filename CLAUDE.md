# Working on this repository

Part of Supertext's "translation plugins for the top 20 open source CMS" project. Each CMS has its own repo named `Supertext/<CMS>-Supertext-Translation`. This one is the **Payload CMS 3** plugin (TypeScript, npm package `payload-supertext-translation`).

## Documentation rule (always)

Every plugin repo keeps three guides, and **every change that affects behaviour, settings, installation or the code structure updates them in the same commit**:

| File | Audience | Must cover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/INSTALLATION.md` | Administrators | Requirements, install/update/uninstall, API key, language setup, all settings, troubleshooting |
| `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` | Editors | How to translate and review in the CMS's own UI, what is and isn't translated, what errors mean |
| `docs/DEVELOPER.md` | Developers | Architecture, Supertext API protocol, local setup, tests, CI/deploy, releasing, known limitations/roadmap |

Also: `README.md` stays a short overview linking the three guides, and `CHANGELOG.md` gets an entry under *Unreleased* for every user-visible change. Before finishing any task, check the docs still match the code.

## Supertext account and API key links (always)

Everywhere an administrator enters or is told about the API key — the settings field's help text, the "no API key" / "authentication failed" messages, `docs/INSTALLATION.md`, `README.md` and the demo's `.env.example` — show both links (same as the WordPress plugin):

- Create a Supertext account (or log in): https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin
- Generate the AI API key: https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api (supertext.com → Integrations → API; requires the **Admin** role)

Wording: "No Supertext account yet? Create one at supertext.com. Generate your API key at supertext.com → Integrations → API (requires the Admin role)." In the UI, links open in a new tab (`target="_blank" rel="noopener"`); where the CMS shows plain text only, use the bare URLs. New screens or messages that mention the key get the links too.

## Demo accounts rule (always)

Every demo must be usable right after deployment, without anyone registering in a browser. On **every start**, the demo creates these accounts if they don't exist yet:

| Variables | Account |
| --- | --- |
| `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Full administrator (for Supertext staff) |
| `DEMO_EDITOR_EMAIL`, `DEMO_EDITOR_PASSWORD` | Editor-level account that can translate content in every demo language; used for automated tests and screenshots. Where the CMS has no editor role that works out of the box, use the closest role and document it. |

- Existing accounts are never modified: no password resets from variables, no duplicates on restart.
- A password that doesn't meet the CMS's own password rules skips that account with a clear warning in the log. The demo still starts.
- Values live only in the hosting platform's variables (Railway). Never in the repo, in chat or in logs. Log the variable name, never the password.
- If the CMS has a first-run "create admin" screen, these accounts replace it. Document that once `DEMO_*` is set, the screen no longer appears.
- If a demo already used CMS-specific names (e.g. `TYPO3_ADMIN_*`, `PAYLOAD_ADMIN_*`), keep them as fallbacks for `DEMO_ADMIN_*`.
- The demo also seeds its target languages and at least one sample entry in the source language, and makes sure the editor account can access every target language.
- Document the variables in `docs/DEVELOPER.md` (demo section) and in the demo's `.env.example`.

## Screenshots rule (always)

The user guide and installation guide of every plugin include screenshots of the real UI: at least the translate action before and after translating, a translated result, the overwrite or retranslate warning if there is one, the plugin's settings or configuration screen, and the CMS's language setup. Screenshots are taken from the repo's own demo with the headless browser, by a committed script (e.g. `npm run docs:screenshots`), against a stand-in API that returns real translations for the sample content, so the guides never show placeholder text. Use no real customer data, no secrets, no local URLs (show the live API endpoint). Keep the images small (1× scale, cropped to the relevant part), store them in `docs/images/`, give each one descriptive alt text, and regenerate them in the same commit whenever the UI they show changes.

## Shared Supertext protocol

AI file translation API v1, same as the WordPress plugin: POST HTML file → poll status → GET translation → DELETE. Details in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`. Never commit API keys; use the `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` environment variable or the plugin's `apiKey` option.

## This repo

- `npm test` (Vitest; includes a real Payload instance on in-memory SQLite), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`. All three must pass before committing.
- New options go in `src/types.ts` **and** the settings table in `docs/INSTALLATION.md`.
- Field-walking rules live in `src/collect.ts`; keep the "Field rules" section of `docs/DEVELOPER.md` in sync.
- `demo/` is the Railway demo site (Dockerfile `demo/Dockerfile`, context = repo root). Changing its collections/globals needs a migration (`cd demo && npm run payload migrate:create <name>`) committed with the change, otherwise the deployed demo won't start. Demo secrets live only in Railway variables.
- The admin component is referenced by import-map path `payload-supertext-translation/client#TranslateButton`; renaming it is a breaking change for users (they must regenerate the import map).
